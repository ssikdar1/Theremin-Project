				<h3> General topic, motivation, background </h3>
				
				<p>
					In the 1920s, a Russian physicist invented an instrument that was made up of two metal antennas that sensed the relative position of the user's hands. 
					The instrument used oscillators to control frequency with one hand and amplitude with the other.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Currently, hand gesture recognition is a common problem for Computer Vision. 
					In our research, we found a few interesting papers related to hand gesture recognition.
					Hand gesture recognition systems are used to help people such as the visually impaired or to help people in therapy. 
					Solanki and Desai from Gujarat Technological University had even attempted to make a remote control for home appliances.
					In Leeds Metropolitan University, a researcher had previously done gesture interaction for electronic music performance
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Our main motivation was to experiment with way to connect audio sounds with hand gesture recognition.
					If we could connect hand gesture information to audio output, then this could add a new dimension to recognition systems. 
					As well, it can be used in fields such as occupational therapy. We looked to the Theremin instrument for inspiration.
					We found papers such as Svilen Dimitrov's "Analyzing Theremin Sounds for Touch Free Gesture Recognition", but often the methods suggested involved looking into systems and hardware.
					We decided we wanted to implement a system that one could use with a simple web camera.
				</p>

				<h3>Goal of the project </h3>
				(Give a problem definition. Why is this an interesting and difficult problem?)
				<p>
					The goal of our project was to try and emulate the functionalities of the Theremin. 
					This involved sub-problems of being able to control volume with one hand and controlling pitch with the other.
